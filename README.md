# Travelog
This mobile based application helps employees of an organisation manage official trips. Trips can be added, modified, deleted and can also be viewed in a list.

## Tech Stack Used
React Native: Frontend development framework for building cross-platform mobile applications.

MySQL: Relational database management system for storing and retrieving travel data.

## Installation
To run this application locally, follow these steps:

1. Install React Native CLI using ```npm install -g react-native-cli```
2. Create a New React Native Project using ```npx react-native init YourAppName```
3. Navigate to the Project Directory using ```cd YourAppName```
4. Create source files under src/components
5. To setup database, here's a typical directory structure for a Node.js backend server

/backend

&emsp;/node_modules

&emsp;/src

&emsp;&emsp;server.js
  
&emsp;package.json

6. Create database and tables using commands from travelapp_triplist.sql
7. Add your database name, password and IP Address (you can identify the correct IP Address below the QR code generated by metro binder) in server.js.
8. Run the Project using ``` npm start ```
9. Scan the QR code to view react native app in your phone. (install and signup for Expo Go from your phone and ensure that your phone and computer are connected to the same network - Wi-Fi or personal hotspot).

## Future Scope

Bills from the trip can also be uploaded for approval or rejection.
